		<h2 style="font-size:200%;">Artec Alnico V-shaped Pickup</h2>
		<p style="font-size:140%;" >
			I already made a demo video comparing this pickup to the stock pickup of the Fender Mexican Standard Strat in the bridge position.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:140%;" >

			I was intrigued by this pickup after doing some searching on Ebay. There are a lot of low-priced rail pickups on Ebay and some are so cheap that it leaves no risk in buying one just to discover if it’s any good or not. As far as I can remember this model was the only Alnico-magnet rail pickup in that affordable price range.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:140%;" >

			Measuring in between 11k – 12k DC resistance (often quoted as a statement of the pickups output, but not entirely accurate), it appears to sport a medium output for such a pickup. The Seymour Duncan Hotrail has a DC resistance of 16.6k, so quite a bit more wire there and it’s a ceramic magnet, so the overall output of a Hotrail is likely to be significantly more than this pickup.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:140%;" >

			That suits me because I don’t like high output pickups that much. I prefer old-school, lower-output humbuckers of the early years, just like I prefer low to almost medium Strat pickups because they have more dynamics and character to their tone to my ears.

			I'll also provide three most sought after humbucking pickups that can take the high end of your guitar tone an additional boost.

			So with the desire to have a more humbucker-like tone for the bridge position without going “metal” and within a very strict budget I figured the spec of this pickup might just work out.

			P.S I'll just post a link in case one you guitar nerds want to find a humbucking pickup to tweek up your sound ;)<br>

			The short answer is that it has worked out – very well I think. It is significantly different to the typical Strat bridge pickup to effectively be a different guitar tonally, whilst still allowing me the familiar comfort of playing the best-designed electric guitar in history.

			I will feature this rail pickup in a video at some point, but for now the demo of the same pickup in the Mexican Strat explains things well enough. It does sound a little different in my Vintage Modified Strat, but that’s always going to happen.

		<img src="pickup.gif" alt="Pickup Image" align="left" style="width:500px;height:240px;"> Here I have apicture of one of my Artec arnico pickup installed in my 1964 Fender Mexican Stratocaster which i installed for less than 20 %. The High Spctrum of the sound has increased marginally and the tone of the guitar is rather on the hotter end of my amp which gives it the spcific drive that is required of guitarists who need the extra puch during their solos. The pickup i placed is placed in the 4th position so that when I try to play the rhythm it does not contemplate the tone of the song yet we are not sacrificing on the lead end.<br><br><br><br>

			In summary, this pickup gives me something close enough to a traditional type of humbucker tone. I wouldn’t say it sounds like a PAF, but it has clarity, a full midrange and not too much bass. It doesn’t get muddy-sounding, but definitely pushes the Strat into more Gibson-esque territory, which is great for certain classic rock covers at gigs, where a Strat is the best guitar for handling all the other styles of music.
